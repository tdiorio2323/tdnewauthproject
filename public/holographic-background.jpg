I need to use your exact image file, but I cannot directly save image files from the conversation. Let me help you save the image manually or use a different approach.

Since I can see you already have some images in your public/uploads directory, you could:
1. Save the holographic image you want to use to `/Users/tylerdiorio/tdnewauthproject/public/holographic-background.jpg`
2. Or let me know if you'd prefer a different filename

Once the image is saved, I'll update the CSS to use that exact background image instead of the generated gradients.
